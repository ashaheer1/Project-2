Because of the high demand of  ethanol in fuel and other uses, there are various processes that are being studied. The aim of these studies is to determine the ideal and optimal conditions for the reactor to be in to produce the most ethanol. Therefore, this paper studies the production of ethanol by the use of a bioreactor containing bacteria cells and substrate. Essentially, in this paper, a mathematical model was used to determine and interpret experimental data from a batch alcohol fermentation process. Moreover in this paper substrate limitations and product inhibition were taken into account when determining the cell concentration and product concentration. Essentially, the substrate (S) is used by the cells (X) to produce the product (E). The paper proposes a kinetic model with a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. These ordinary differential equations have a whole set of parameters which affect the ODEs. Figure 1 shows the set of ordinary differential equations and the parameters that these equations depend on.
